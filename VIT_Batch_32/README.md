Dam Water level Alert System:



Aim: The aim of this project is to develop a prototype that mimics a "Dam water level sensing and alert system". Upon successful completion of this project, we aim to have a functioning prototype of the Dam Water Level Sensing and Alert System that can serve as a foundation for the development of a comprehensive solution for dam safety and management.


Result: The result aims to provide a reliable, cost-effective, and user-friendly system for dam water level monitoring and alerting. It should enhance dam safety and management by ensuring that potential issues are detected early, allowing for timely responses and risk reduction. The project's success will depend on thorough development, testing, and validation of all system components to ensure its effectiveness in real-world dam environments.
